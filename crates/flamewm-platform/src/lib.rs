//! FlameWM product policy ported from the current native C++ implementation.
//!
//! This crate owns product semantics, not window-manager protocol state. The native FlameWM desktop backend
//! engine remains authoritative for windows, focus, stacking, work areas, EWMH/ICCCM and native
//! X11 resources.
