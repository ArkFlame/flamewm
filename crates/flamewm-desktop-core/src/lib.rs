//! Crash-isolated filesystem desktop model and file-operation policy.
//!
//! Native X11 surfaces and the inotify file descriptor adapter stay outside this crate. The model,
//! watcher reconciliation, filesystem actions and Freedesktop Trash semantics are real Rust code
//! and can be exercised without a running window manager.
