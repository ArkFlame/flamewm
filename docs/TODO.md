# FlameWM Rust WebRender — Complete Product TODO

This is the canonical implementation backlog after 0.0.2. A checked item means active production source exists in this branch; it does not mean every runtime corner is verified in the artifact assembly environment.

## Phase 0 — independent branch foundation

- [x] Remove `/engine` and all active IceWM/IceWM-Rust runtime dependencies.
- [x] Keep historical projects under `.vendor/` only.
- [x] Enforce no active `.vendor` path/source dependency.
- [x] Correct workspace version/rust-version metadata.
- [x] Rust 1.85 / edition 2024 workspace contract.
- [x] Independent `flamewm-wm` crate using `x11rb`.
- [x] Flame-owned product/platform/core crate workspace.
- [x] FlameWM Render 0.0.6 source promoted into active renderer crates.
- [x] V8 0.0.6 presentation/assets promoted as active visual baseline.
- [x] `doctor`, `check`, release `xephyr`, `verify-visual`, memory helper.
- [x] SourcePort post-mortem preserved and converted into `docs/PORTING_METHOD.md`.
- [ ] Target machine: `./check` compiler/test/release gate PASS.
- [ ] Target machine: `./xephyr` interactive PASS.
- [ ] Target machine: `./verify-visual` differential metrics recorded.
